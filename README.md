### Goodness gracious! A new sight to behold!

'sup? Name's Ona, currently taking up programming as a career 'cause I thought it'd be fun to mess around with code as I usually stick around with my PC all day.

Currently taking up PHP, C#, and Javascript, mostly Back-end stuff.
Also have some prowess with SQL code, both SQL Server and MySQL syntaxes.
